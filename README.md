# Prerequisites
Jenkins (with the necessary plugins)
*Git plugin
* plugin
*Pipeline plugin
Docker: For building and pushing Docker images.
GitHub account: For the repository and storing the application code.
Docker Hub account: For storing the Docker images.
Python (Python 3.x): To run the application and install dependencies.
# step by step environment
abouve git repo and files 
create a new job python-cicd-app in jenkins
manage creditioals like dockerhub user pass and git

# Configure Docker Hub Credentials in Jenkins
In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins â†’ Manage Credentials and add your Docker Hub credentials. Use this credentials ID in the Jenkins pipeline to authenticate and push Docker images.

# Install Dependencies and Build Docker Image

necessary dependencies in the requirements.txt file 
The Dockerfile builds the Docker image for the Python application.
# Running the Pipeline
Once Jenkins is set up with the pipeline script and credentials, trigger the pipeline manually or automatically with every commit to the GitHub repository.
Jenkins will:
Clone the repository.
Install the Python dependencies.
Build the Docker image.
Push the image to Docker Hub.

# Access the Docker Image
then acces the image # docker pull purna6/python-ci-cd-app

# conclusion
This setup automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Python application using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline ensures that every change pushed to GitHub is automatically built, tested, and deployed to Docker Hub, improving efficiency and reliability.

# Access the Application in Your Browser
